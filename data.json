We prepared dinner but we thought with the seas and the crew tummies we decides snacks were easier to hand around.\n\nThis morning the wind has dropped so we have the full sail and the genoa out and have between 8.5 kts and 9.7 kts.\n\nOur first 24 hours run was 175NM.\n\nLatitude: -20.50243333\nLongitude: 176.8491",
