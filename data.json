We prepared dinner but we thought with the seas and the crew tummies we decides snacks were easier to hand around.\n\nThis morning the wind has dropped so we have the full sail and the genoa out and have between 8.5 kts and 9.7 kts.\n\nOur first 24 hours run was 175NM.\n\nLatitude: -20.50243333\nLongitude: 176.8491",

So good that lunch by cook Leo and was prime steak, veggies and followed with fresh pawpaw with lime juice.  This morning we have had  wind up to 24kts so we were 1 reef and the staysail out and some surfing up to 12.7 kts, very pleasant.  We have some great guidance from one of Alan's sailor mates who has been sending weather information and he is right on the money, very helpful. We have slowed down as there is a tricky cyclone at the top of the of the north island and as we are such polite Gents we are letting it going first before we pick up speed again.  Did I mention saying any thing about being chicken???\n\n24 hour run: 190nm\n\nLatitude: -23.6495\nLongitude: 176.2840667",

Today is sunny and still warm sailing into a moderate sea.  All feeling good.\n\nLatitude: -26.14531667\nLongitude: 175.69775",

The wind was 20 to 30 kts and the sea was not being nice to us with large swells and choppy waves last night but has calmed a little now.  Breakfast was about 1100AM for the crew!
